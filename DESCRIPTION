Description: A package for incorporating eigenvectors of
    variance-covariance matrices into phylogenetic analyses. Given a
    phylogenetic tree, 'eiger' computes and visualizes the contributions
    of the branches to the eigenvectors of some version of
    variance-covariance matrix of the tree. If trait values and other variables are provided,
    'eiger' can also run phylogenetic generalized least squares with
    eigenvectors included as fixed effects.
