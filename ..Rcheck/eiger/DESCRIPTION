Description: A package for incorporating eigenvectors of
    variance-covariance matrices into phylogenetic analyses. Given a
    phylogenetic tree, 'eiger' computes and visualizes the contributions
    of the branches to the eigenvectors of some version of
    variance-covariance matrix of the tree. If trait values are provided,
    'eiger' can also run phylogenetic generalized least squares with
    eigenvectors included as fixed effects to investigate whether the
    traits are associated.
